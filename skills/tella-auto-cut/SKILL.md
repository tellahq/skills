description: Tighten a Tella video in one pass through the Tella MCP. Cuts recording mistakes (false starts, retakes, repeated phrases, abandoned sentences), filler words and silent pauses, then cleans up the gaps and broken seams those cuts leave behind. Use when asked to auto cut, auto edit, clean up, or tighten a recording.

# Auto cut a Tella video

Cut the mistakes, the fillers and the silences from every clip, then read the result back and fix what the cuts left behind: pauses that joined across a cut, doubled words and leftover fragments.

This skill needs the Tella MCP. If tools such as `get_timeline` are missing, follow the connection steps in the `tella` skill first.

## Scope

Auto cut is a direct action: cut, then report what you did. Don't ask for approval of the mistake list first; the user can restore or adjust afterwards. Ask only when you can't tell which video or clip is meant.

It cuts silent stretches even when something is happening on screen. Pace is the silence mode: `natural` (pauses over 800 ms) unless the user asks for `fast` (500 ms) or `faster` (300 ms). If the user only wants some of the steps ("just the silences"), do only those, but still run the final pass.

Don't change layouts, zooms, overlays or captions.

## Workflow

Work clip by clip; transcripts, word indices and cuts are all per clip. `get_timeline` lists the clips. Before cutting, call `get_clip` on each one and keep its `cuts`, so you can say how to restore it.

1. **Mistakes.** Follow steps 1–3 and 5 of the `tella-remove-mistakes` skill, with its rules in [../tella-remove-mistakes/references/mistake-rules.md](../tella-remove-mistakes/references/mistake-rules.md): read the transcript, find the mistakes, and cut them with one `cut_clip_by_transcript` call per clip. Skip its review step (step 4). Its rule still holds: when unsure, leave it in.
2. **Fillers.** `remove_fillers` on each clip.
3. **Silences.** `remove_silences` on each clip with the chosen `mode`. If it answers that the audio analysis is still processing, wait a little and try again, at most a few times; if it still isn't ready, skip silences for that clip, do the final pass anyway and say so in the report.
4. **Final pass.** See below.
5. **Report** per clip: the mistakes cut (time, reason, words), that fillers and silences were removed, the gaps and seams the final pass fixed, and the clip's length before and after. Say how to restore (below).

Mistakes go first because they are the step that needs reading. The other steps don't depend on order: word indices never shift, and `remove_silences` works from the original recording.

## Final pass

`remove_silences` finds pauses in the original recording and ignores the clip's cuts. When a mistake or filler is cut, the pause before it and the pause after it now play back to back. Each was shorter than the threshold, so neither was cut, but together they play as one long gap. The transcript after all cuts is the only place that shows what actually plays.

1. **Re-read the transcript** with `get_transcript` (in windows for long clips, as in the mistakes skill). Times are on the playback timeline, with every cut applied.
2. **Trim long gaps.** For each pair of neighbouring words, the gap is the next word's `startTimeMs` minus the previous word's `endTimeMs`. Where it is longer than the mode's threshold (800 / 500 / 300 ms), cut `{fromMs: previous.endTimeMs + 120, toMs: next.startTimeMs - 120}`, which leaves 120 ms of air next to each word. Treat the gap before the first word and after the last word the same way, keeping 120 ms next to the word. Send every range for a clip in one `cut_clip` call: ranges are resolved against the playback timeline as it was when the call started, so a second call would use shifted times.
3. **Fix broken seams.** Read across each cut and look for what the cuts left:
   - the same word on both sides of a cut ("the the"): cut one of them;
   - one or two stray words stranded between two cuts that no longer belong to either sentence: cut them;
   - a sentence that no longer reads because a mistake cut took too much or too little: move the cut by whole words.

   Fix these with `cut_clip_by_transcript` on the word indices. Never split a word or pad a range with extra words.
4. **Listen to a few seams** with `get_clip_preview`, picking the ones with the most cuts close together. A word that ends right at a cut can sound clipped; move that cut by a whole word rather than adjusting milliseconds.

Run the final pass once, then report anything you saw but left alone.

## Restoring

A single cut can't be undone cleanly: a mistake cut merges with the filler and silence cuts next to it. To restore a clip, call `update_clip` with the `cuts` you saved from `get_clip` before starting (or `cuts: []` to remove every cut, including ones the clip had before). To redo with different choices, restore and run again.

If a cut call fails or its outcome is unclear, re-read the transcript before retrying: words that were cut are absent from it. Never blindly repeat a cut.
